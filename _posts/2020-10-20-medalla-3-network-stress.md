title: "The Medalla Network Under Stress"
permalink: "/posts/medalla-network-stress/"
---
One of the most obvious features of the data presented in the [previous article](/posts/medalla-validator-taxonomy) was the crash in participation rate which occurred at the time of the [roughtime incident](https://medium.com/prysmatic-labs/eth2-medalla-testnet-incident-f7fbc3cc934a). A number of important lessons were identified from this incident, such as:
- the importance of client diversity;
- the perils of depending on centralised service providers for consensus-critical information;
- the value of easy and seemless switching between clients for validators;
- the importance of rigorous release testing, even (especially) during a crisis;
- \[and many others\].

But of course, Medalla is a testnet â€” exposing and fixing such potential weaknesses is one of the main reasons for running it. Furthermore, from the perspective of getting data and improving our understanding of how the network behaves under severe stress, it was an unexpected gift.

We've already seen from the impact on the participation rate one of the ways in which network stress can manifest itself. In this article, we will look at a series of other metrics which may contain valuable information about network performance, providing cues about bugs or other problems. Once again, we start by getting some useful data from `chaind`:

## Attestation metrics

To look at the health of the Medlla network, we're going to generate some metrics about validators' attestation performance. We've already looked at one important attestation metric: the *participation rate*. We'll calculate this again, ignoring unresponsive validators (those we previously categorised as absent, dormant or abandoned).

The other metrics we calculate are:

1. mean inclusion distance;
2. mean attestation effectiveness;
3. attestation accuracy.

We will define each of these metrics as we plot them in the below charts.

<details><summary><code>input 4</code></summary>

```python
# calculate mean inclusion distance, mean attestation effectiveness, attestation accuracy metrics

start_time = time.time()
last_update = 0

empty = [0] * n_epochs
success_count      = empty.copy()
unresponsive_count = empty.copy()
missed_count       = empty.copy()
correct_count      = empty.copy()
sum_distance       = empty.copy()
sum_ae             = empty.copy()

for slot in range(n_epochs * 32):
    cursor.execute(f"SELECT f_validator_index, f_performance, f_effectiveness, f_correct "
                   f"FROM t_validator_performance WHERE f_slot = {slot}")
    result = cursor.fetchone()
    validator_indices  = result[0]
    performance        = result[1]
    effectiveness      = result[2]
    correct            = result[3]
    
    epoch = slot // 32
    for position, val_index in enumerate(validator_indices):
        if performance[position] != -1:
            success_count[epoch]      += 1
            sum_distance[epoch]       += performance[position]
            sum_ae[epoch]             += effectiveness[position]
            if correct[position] == 1:
                correct_count[epoch] += 1
        elif (validators[val_index]["latest_attestation"] == -1
              or epoch < validators[val_index]["first_attestation"]
              or epoch > validators[val_index]["latest_attestation"]):
            unresponsive_count[epoch] += 1
        else:
            missed_count[epoch]       += 1

    t = time.time()
    if t - last_update > 0.1:
        last_update = t
        seconds = t - start_time
        elapsed = time.strftime("%H:%M:%S",time.gmtime(seconds))
        left = time.strftime("%H:%M:%S",time.gmtime(seconds * ((latest_slot+1) / (slot+1)-1)))
        percentage = 100*(slot+1)/(latest_slot+1)
        print(f"epoch {epoch} of {latest_slot//32} ({percentage:.2f}%) / "
              f"{elapsed} elapsed / {left} left", end='\r')

participation_rate = [100 * s / (s + missed_count[e] + unresponsive_count[e]) 
                      for e, s in enumerate(success_count)]

participation_rate_reduced = [100 * s / (s + missed_count[e]) for e, s in enumerate(success_count)]

mean_inclusion_distance = [sd / success_count[e] if success_count[e] > 0 else None
                           for e, sd in enumerate(sum_distance)]

mean_ae = [100 * ae / (success_count[e] + missed_count[e] + unresponsive_count[e])
           if success_count[e] > 0 else 0 for e, ae in enumerate(sum_ae)]

mean_ae_reduced = [100 * sum_ae[e] / (success_count[e] + missed_count[e]) if success_count[e] > 0 else 0
                   for e, ae in enumerate(sum_ae)]

accuracy = [100 * c / success_count[e] if success_count[e] > 0 else 0 for e, c in enumerate(correct_count)]

clear_output()
print(f"completed in {elapsed}")
```

</details>

```
output:
    completed in 00:17:22
```

## Participation Rate
We looked at the participation rate in the [previous article](/posts/medalla-validator-taxonomy). It's plotted again below, both with and without unresponsive validators, this time as a line graph for easier comparison with the other metrics.

<details><summary><code>input 5</code></summary>

```python
# plot participation rate

participation_rate_series = pd.Series(participation_rate)

participation_rate_reduced_series = pd.Series(participation_rate_reduced)

fig=plt.figure(figsize=(16,6))
plt.plot(participation_rate_series, label='participation rate')
plt.plot(participation_rate_reduced_series, label='participation rate (excl. unresponsive)')
plt.margins(0,0)
plt.title('Participation rate by epoch')
plt.xlabel('epoch')
plt.ylabel('participation rate (%)')
plt.legend(loc='lower right')
plt.show()
```

## Mean inclusion distance
Another metric we can use to look at the health of the network is how quickly validators are able to have their attestations included into the beacon chain. As mentioned above, this is called the *inclusion distance*, which is the number of slots it takes for an attestatation to be included in a canonical block. By averaging this across all validators who successfully attested in a given epoch, we get a quantity called the *mean inclusion distance*.

One advantage of this measure is that it is not directly affected by the presence unresponsive validators, since only attestations which are acually included contribute.

Unsurprisingly, the mean inclusion distance jumps significantly around the roughtime incident. But interestingly there are a number of smaller spikes, some (but not all) of which match downward spikes in the participation rate.

<details><summary><code>input 6</code></summary>

```python
# graphs and stats for mean inclusion distance

mid_series = pd.Series(mean_inclusion_distance)

# plot the mean inclusion distance
fig=plt.figure(figsize=(16,6))
plt.plot(mid_series, label='mean inclusion distance')
plt.margins(0,0)
plt.title('Mean inclusion distance of successful attestations')
plt.xlabel('epoch')
plt.ylabel('mean inclusion distance (slots)')
plt.show()
```

</details>

## Attestation Effectiveness
A metric that combines participation rate and inclusion distance into a single score describing a validator's performance is *attestation effectiveness*, $E_a$ which has been defined by [Jim McDonald](https://www.attestant.io/posts/defining-attestation-effectiveness/) as the ratio between the minimum possible delay for inclusion of an attestation, and the actual delay:

$$ E_a = \frac{S_n-S_a}{S_i-S_a} $$

Where $S_n$ is then next slot containing a block, $S_a$ is the slot number being attested to, and $S_i$ is the slot at which the attestation was actually included. In the best case, the attestation is included at the next possible slot, i.e. $S_i=S_n$ and the attestation effectiveness $E_a=1$. If no attestation is included then $E_a=0$. In effect then, inclusion delay is measured from the next slot containing a canonical block, since empty slots will cause attestations to be delayed through no fault of the validator.

<details><summary><code>input 7</code></summary>

```python
# plot attestation effectiveness

mean_ae_series = pd.Series(mean_ae)

mean_ae_reduced_series = pd.Series(mean_ae_reduced)

# plot the mean inclusion distance
fig=plt.figure(figsize=(16,6))
plt.plot(mean_ae_series, label='mean attestation effectiveness')
plt.plot(mean_ae_reduced_series, label='mean attestation effectiveness (excl. unresponsive)')
plt.margins(0,0)
plt.title('Mean attestation effectiveness')
plt.xlabel('epoch')
plt.ylabel('attestation effectiveness (%)')
plt.legend(loc='lower right')
plt.show()
```

</details>

## Attestation Accuracy
A subtler measure of attestation performance may be descibred as *attestation accuracy*. In this case we are interested in whether each validator attested to the correct *head root* at each slot.

By *correct* here, we mean that given an attestation for slot $S_a$, the head root chosen is:
1. canonical;
2. the most recent canonical block up to and including slot $S_a$.

So for example if a validator votes for a block in slot $S_a-1$, having not received any block in slot $S_a$ (due to network latency or other problems), but a block for slot $S_a$ later *does* become part of the finalised chain, then the validator can be said to have attested *incorrectly*. This is true even though the block to which they attested was itself canonical, and *was* at the chain head to the best of that validator's knowledge at time of attestation. Validators who attest incorrectly to the chain head receive no reward for that aspect of their attestation.

As in the case of mean inclusion distance, we are concerned only with attestations which were included in the canonical chain, so there is no difference from excluding unresponsive validators.

# plot accuracy rate by epoch

accuracy_series = pd.Series(accuracy)

# plot accuracy

plt.xlabel('epoch')
plt.ylabel('mean accuracy (%)')
plt.show()
```

## Block Production Metrics (Empty Slots and Orphaned Blocks)
Apart from validators' performance on their attestation duties, we can also look at how validators perform as block producers. According to the eth2 spec, one validator is selected to produce a block at each slot. However for various reasons the validator might fail to do so, or might produce a block that is invalid.

Another possibility is that the assigned validator does produce a block, but it does no propagate to the rest of the network quickly enough to be included in the canonical chain. This block is then descrined as "orphaned". Equivalently, the block is *non-canonical*, as it did not become part of the finalised chain.

The set of orphaned blocks is generally subjective â€” in theory there might be an orphaned block for every empty slot. In practice there will be slots for which no block was ever produced (for example because the validator assigned to produce it was unresponseive). The orphaned blocks included the `chaind` database are those which were available to the beacon node which collected them. Different nodes in different parts of the network may have been able to collect other orphaned blocks which ultimately were not propagated throughout the whole network.

Nonetheless, counts of both empty slots and orphaned blocks can serve as another metric for network health. Since a maximum of only 32 blocks is produced each epoch, these metrics are much coarser than the attestation metrics we considered above (by contrast thousands of attestations may be produced each epoch).

For empty slots, we can use look at the attestation duties to determine which validator had been assigned to produce a block. As with the previous metrics, we can then exclude unresponsive validators to see if this gives us a clearer picture.

<details><summary><code>input 9</code></summary>

```python
# count orphaned blocks

cursor.execute("SELECT COUNT(*), SUM(f_canonical::int) FROM t_blocks")
n_blocks, n_canonical = cursor.fetchone()
n_orphaned = n_blocks - n_canonical
print(f"Dataset contains {n_blocks} blocks of which {n_orphaned} ({100*(n_orphaned/n_blocks):.1f}%) orphaned")

# count empty slots

cursor.execute("SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_blocks WHERE f_canonical")
n_empty = n_slots - cursor.fetchone()[0]
print(f"Dataset encompases {n_slots} slots of which {n_empty} ({100*(n_empty/n_slots):.1f}%) were empty")
```

</details>

```
output:
    Dataset contains 358048 blocks of which 8192 (2.3%) orphaned
    Dataset encompases 487601 slots of which 137745 (28.2%) were empty
